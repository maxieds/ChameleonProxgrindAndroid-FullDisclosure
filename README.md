# ChameleonProxgrindAndroid-FullDisclosure

## Prior disclosure to the vendor

In accordance with the guidelines for reporting to BugTraq [here](https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/description#0.1.8), I will first point out that a clear detailed report of the problem in this vulnerability has been made to the [vendor's contact point](mailto:dennis@rfidresearchgroup.com). Their response after I gave them a clear window to respond was to make the following comments to me quickly:
>So what am I suppose to do or what can I do to help with your problem ?
>
>I think it is better you state your concerns and bulletin it so I can go to my CTO with a more details on your concerns and how we can achieve more together ?
With a lacking response now days after my initial point of contact email, I feel that it is pertinent to warn users of the malware they have unwittingly purchased and installed on their Android phones to control it. 

## The proxgrind series of Chameleon Mini devices

TODO

## The vulnerability (clear instance of malware), and how it was noticed


My opinion: proliferation by broken BLE stack and intentional supression of documentation for their devices...
